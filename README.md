# Lingoda study resources

The execution of this script allows the user to download automatically the available material in PDF format from Lingoda language lessons. These PDFs are completely available for each student, but manual downloading could take time. 

## Instructions

### Download HTML layout from course
The HTML layout from the course overview is required, and it must be downloaded manually (as it requires authentication to access, and doing it programmatically is just longer, and the task is pretty easy tbh). 

For level A1.2, navigate to: 
https://www.lingoda.com/en/account/course-overview/A1.2.
For the next levels, modify the end of the URL, or just navigate in the webpage. 

Save the website with `Ctrl+S` with Chrome, or other web browser, in the folder `webpages`. It should be saved with the name of the level. For instance, the level A1.2 should have the name `A1.2`.  
This repository includes the HTML files for GERMAN. The other languages are not accessible from my account, and they should be downloaded and included in the respective folder.

### Choose the Level to download
You must specify the levels you want to download in the variable `level` from the code.
